# Lab 1: TensorFlow Basics
This lab will introduce the basics of writing programs with TensorFlow.

To be honest, this week doesn't involve building anything terribly exciting.
Combine that with the number of definitions, algorithms, and TensorFlow features we're going to cover, and it might be hard to see why we care about differentiable programming at all.
But this week's concepts are absolutely foundational, and if you get through it you should know basically everything about writing simple programs in TensorFlow.
Stick with it, and I promise it's worth it -- we'll be building cool things soon.

Concepts this week:
 - Tensors (rank, shape, data type) as used in TensorFlow
 - Computational graphs
 - Differentiable programming
 - Gradient descent algorithm

TensorFlow features this week:
 - Overview of API levels
 - Tensors, tensor values, and tensor slices
 - Operations
 - Variables
 - Name scopes
 - Reshapes, transpositions, and reductions
 - Defining a computational graph in the Graph object
 - Subgraph execution with Sessions
 - Computing gradients, numerical optimization with Optimizers
