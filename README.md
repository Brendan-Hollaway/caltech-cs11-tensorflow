# caltech-cs11-tensorflow
Repository for the CS11 Tensorflow track. Course outline [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TSouogmnP0fgxwrlOyasWnNaG0aKX3i9tmuzZKjct1Y/edit?usp=sharing).

Resources:
-
 - Documentation:
   - [Tensorflow official API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/): The official documentation; hard to search effectively but the individual pages are good
   - [Tensorflow official API (devdocs version)](https://devdocs.io/tensorflow~python/): An easier-to-search rehost of the official documentation, which I usually prefer to use
   - [Tensorflow official guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/): A short, high-quality tutorial series by the TF developers
 - Derivatives on a computational graph:
   - [Calculus on Computational Graphs: Backpropagation](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/): Intuitively building up backpropagation on a graph from simple calculus
   - [Hacker's Guide to Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/): The first part of this (awesome!) article explains backpropagation with examples in code and logic circuits
 - Differentiable programming concepts:
   - [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35): An ambitious piece by the director of AI at Tesla in which differential programming is the way most (all?) future software will be written
   - [2016 Microsoft Research Slides](http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~gunes/files/Baydin-MSR-Slides-20160201.pdf): Slide deck from a research presentation contrasting automatic differentiation (AD) to differentiable programming and covering some topics in both fields
 - Cool stuff:
   - [Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/)
   - [Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/)
   - [Christopher Olah's entire blog](https://colah.github.io/)
